      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been developing a script that takes the dimensions of a structure and automatically constructs a prefab of the structure made up of individual destructable bricks. In the latest incarnation I&amp;rsquo;ve added an entrance.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;First off, I know almost nothing about Art Engine so the fact I could get it to do some useful stuff in next to no time is a good start. This blog post is about what I tried.
&lt;img src=&#34;https://t-images.imgix.net/https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.t-cdn.net%2F5dccae9e067deb2d2d704ff2%2Fposts%2F5ee8d80a20b6af5d4fef7614%2F5ee8d80a20b6af5d4fef7614_58946.png?width=1240&amp;w=1240&amp;auto=format%2Ccompress&amp;ixlib=js-2.3.1&amp;s=632419e696aab8957cf5272c4b92ccf5&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Health/Progress bar via a Shader</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a fairly common requirement to have some sort of health-bar or progress-bar in a game. However, as explained by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.stevestreeting.com/2019/02/22/enemy-health-bars-in-1-draw-call-in-unity&#34;   target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;Steve Streeting&lt;/a&gt; this can have performance problems if you&amp;rsquo;re using a Canvas and assigning it to many entities. The answer is to use a Shader, but what does that look like? This morning I set about trying to create one and this is my result;

      <title>Auto Convert Roads Types from Real World Terrain</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Real World Terrain is a great Unity Asset to kick start a Unity Terrain based upon a real life location.
One of the helpful features is that it will can also be used in conjunction with EasyRoads3D to generate a road network based on actual road data.
However, you might find yourself in a situation were you&amp;rsquo;ve requested that all roads types (highways to dirt paths) are included but you end up with everything looking like 6 metre asphalt roads.
If you&amp;rsquo;re in this situation then you can use the following script (or tweaked to your needs) to convert them to something more useful.
&lt;strong&gt;NB It also sets the width of the road to that specified in the meta data.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>I was scratching my head today as I suddenly wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to use the either the Terrain tools or GeNa to paint/stamp trees onto my Terrain. Turns out that Vegetation Studio Pro turns off the ability here;</description>
