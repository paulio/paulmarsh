I used SpeedTree to create a Gorse Bush. It's a tricky proposition as it's, figurativley and literally, very thorny
and that doesn't work too well with the Tree model. But it's going quite well,
so I've added some variants with some of the animals I bought from the Asset store. Starting to look like a proper scene.
